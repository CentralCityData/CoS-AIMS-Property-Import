### AIMS Property Import Code.

This code collects information from two sources in order to generate a property import file for the AIMS CE (Code Enforcement) application.

1. RPS (Using Hamer Extract SQL Code).
2. County 911 Data. (Using a connection to Onondaga County's ArcGIS Server).

The output of these scripts is the Property_Import file, which should be loaded into the AIMS application.
